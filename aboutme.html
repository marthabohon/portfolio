  <h2 style="color:blue;">Reflection</h2>
  <p style="color:purple;">Debugging was troublesome but also interesting. And a little frustrating. Sometimes it just did not seem to make any sense at all, but when we figured out what the error was it was very satisfying, like when Melissa found that we had indented something we shouldnt've, or when I figured out the colors.</p>
