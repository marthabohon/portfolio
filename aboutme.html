  <h1 style="color:blue;float: center;">Martha Bohon</h1>
  <p style="color:purple;">I go to  claremont high school, I have one cat called princess and she is a <del>spoiled brat who only comes to you when she wants something</del> perfectly sweet and adorable princess. I like watching youtube.</p>
  
  <h2 style="color:blue;">Short Bibliography</h2>
  <p style="color:purple;">I go to  claremont high school, I am trying to make a portfolio.</p>
  
  
  <h2 style="color:blue;">Likes and Dislikes</h2>
  <p style="color:purple;">I like cats, and I also like our cat princess. I also like puns. You should sea how many I can make up. I have a whole ocean of them. Some of them sound a little fishy though. But most of my jokes are pretty fluid.</p>
  
  <h2 style="color:blue;">Fun Facts</h2>
  <p style="color:purple;">I love cats. I am secretly also a cat 0_o.</p>
  
  <h2 style="color:blue;">Favorite Websites</h2>
  <p style="color:purple;"></p>

  <h2 style="color:blue;">Reflection</h2>
  
  <p style="color:purple;">Debugging was troublesome but also interesting. And a little frustrating. Sometimes it just did not seem to make any sense at all, but when we figured out what the error was it was very satisfying, like when Melissa found that we had indented something we shouldnt've, or when I figured out the colors.</p>
  
  <p>6/23/17 So basically a list is a list of items, something that holds multiple items that can be used. I think for the most part all of my groups have been pretty good. I like the one I am in because we can get things done when it is a group project and help each other out.</p>
    <p style="color:purple;">7/5/17 I learned that websites and webpages are different from each other and how they interact with servers. Mainly markup I would think, because it rearranges and formats, but also programming because it changes things too. 7/6/17 I would like more practice learning how to create a webpage, because honestly I did not understand the Django Framework that the site was trying to explain as it went along; there was just too much information all at once. I feel like I understand how to access files and use the command panel pretty well though, and debugging is something I can start looking how to do myself. Sometimes. Like I made two typos recently and I figured out that I made two typos. Two though. TWO. Why. I literally just had to write what they wrote in the Django tutorial and I messed it up twice in like two steps. TWO TIMES. I HAD ONE JOB. ONE JOB. </p>
